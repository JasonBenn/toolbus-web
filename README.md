## TOOLBUS-WEB

Measure what you know, master what you don’t.

The gem parses your code into syntax trees, compares them to a database of language-specific “missions”, and uploads your completion data to the backend. Visit the website to view the most popular missions you haven't yet completed.

This quantifies your knowledge of a programming tool and enables efficient, self-guided, project-based learning.
